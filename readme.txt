  management bug in iOS 7. The bug is fixed in the upcoming iOS 7.1.
- The top and bottom browser bars can't be removed in iOS 7.0 with
  small screens. The user experience is slightly better on iOS 7.1 
  where Turtle can hide the bars - they still might pop up every 
  now and then.
- On iOS 7 clicking a link near the top might activate the top bar
  instead of the link. Turn off "Stick control to top" to get
  better user experience on small screen iOS7 devices.
- Google Chrome reports the attribute required for iOS7 'minimal-ui'
  as an error. No other consequences though.

Being this a major release with lots of modifications, I suggest you 
to test the local version thoroughly before uploading.

can break some of the album functionality. Use with precaution and test.
- If you want to play safe, disable the "Make slides" option on Settings / Pages / 
Advanced / Make slides - jAlbum might turn it on occasionally

Version 3.4.1 July 6, 2012

New features:
- You can give a name to the "up link" (e.g. "All albums")
- ZIP originals or down-scaled images per folder and offer for download
  (not only the whole album)

Changed:
- The "up link" feature has been moved into jAlbum's functionality, see on
  "Settings / Pages" panel.
- Facebook Like, Twitter Tweet and Tumblr buttons removed from the individual
  images, because they were not referring to the image, but the whole album.

Fixed:
- Missing thumbnail of videos with "Link to originals" with no "Copy originals"
- Bug with XLSX, DOCX, PPTX files
- Facebook commenting might run out of the scroller area if there were no album
  images in a folder

Updated:
- Korean translation by Jaehyung Lee, Hungarian translation

Notes:
- jAlbum will take over the old up link settings of Turtle.
- ZIP originals works even if you don't select the "Link to originals" or
  "Copy originals".
- The ZIP feature always creates (and Uploads) the ZIP files even if that's 
  unnecessary, because Turtle cannot detect if the files has changed. We might 
  implement some change detection later. Sorry for the inconvenience! 

------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.4.0 Jun 20, 2012

New features:
- Facebook Commenting
- Visitors can download the whole album as ZIP

Fixed:
- Controls should disappear quicker on touch devices
- Videos did not scale to fit initially, only after clicking the fit/1:1 button
- Thumbnail for sharing was not available when none of the sharing was selected

Please note, due to the fact the ZIP format does not store the Encoding (locale) 
of the file and folder names you might get broken file names (and albums) after 
extraction on Widows. Java encodes these names to UTF-8, which is used by OSX 
and Linux by default. Windows, however, is decoding them using the visitor PC's 
locale (never UTF-8). We will create a little applet by which visitors can decode 
these ZIP files properly, but until then I suggest you to keep with simple ASCII 
file and folder names, and use the "Title" field in Edit mode to add accented 
characters. This method is more safe for using the album on the web too.

For the Facebook commenting feature you will need to create a new app on 
Facebook's developer center: https://developers.facebook.com/ Copy the App ID in 
Turtle's  Facebook App ID box. You can use the same App ID on all pages of your 
site.

------------------------------------------------------

- You can skip the folders from the thumbnail list (if you prefer the top navigation bar)

------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.8 Dec 5, 2011

Modified:
- Removed .htaccess file from the skin, because it didn't work with all servers, and possibly could overwrite the user's own, previously added one. Those who experience "Internal Error 500" errors on their server don't need to regenerate the album however, just go into the "Upload / Manage" (Ctrl-M), Connect, click the wrench icon, and remove .htaccess file from the problem folder.

Info: .htaccess file was added in order to define the correct mime types (file handling by type) and to fine tune caching by file type. (E.g. JPG files can remain in the cache for longer times, while HTML files need to skip the cache.)

------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.7 Dec 1, 2011

------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.3 Oct 11, 2011

New feature:
- Sharing options on the Info panel too. Please note, that not all sharing sites support links with hash, which is used by Turtle skin to link directly to the actual image. Even though Facebook will link to the actual image, it takes its thumbnail from the static page, that is it will use the Theme image, not the actual.

Fixed:
- Albums with "Link to original" used the high resolution images as thumbnail, resulting in slow page loads
- With transition type "Crossfade" the Zoom-in effect took place while in "Fit to screen" mode, causing slower transitions
- Better reference to album thumbnail that Facebook will like more, hopefully

------------------------------------------------------

New feature:
- Better touch control on Android devices

Updated:

Fixed:
- Background image is centered instead of stretched in FireFox 3.5 & 3.6
- Some styles had texts hard to read

------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.1

UPGRADING FROM TURTLE 1.x ALBUM PROJECTS

Using Black or White stlyes, please re-select the style (not the skin), to allow the new background and text color settings be set. Without this you might end up in unreadable text.

You can also opt for the "Legacy" styles which were made to mimic the old (v 1.x) styles.

The following settings need attention when opening old projects, because they will be reset to their default values (in parentheses):

- Splash size (Image width x Image height * 0.66)
- Reduce Thumbs (2 / 3)
- Facebook Like button (no)
- Show photo data (no)

These changes were necessary because the skin's code has been rewritten to work with other upcoming skins.

Splash image is now referred as Theme image. You can select it by Right-click -> Use as folder image option.

The Location and Shop option data added manually in the Edit mode has changed names too, but you can apply the Tools / External Tools / Rename Slide Variables tool with the following parameters to keep them working in the new version: 
- _location = location
- _shopOptions = shopOptions

This change was necessary because jAlbum app has changed its handling of slide variables.

Besides the above changes the BlackBlue and BlackRed styles were removed, though tons of new styles were added at the same time.

The Shopping cart feature is only available for Premium or Power account holders and those who've bough the Pro license. Jalbum.net's past donators will also receive the Pro licence.
